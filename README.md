# ðŸ“ˆ AI-Driven Marketing Campaign Analysis

This project leverages machine learning and data analytics to evaluate and optimize marketing campaign performance. It includes data preprocessing, segmentation, predictive modeling, and feature importance analysis â€” all focused on understanding and improving lead conversion and ROI.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Clean and preprocess marketing campaign data
- Segment audiences using clustering (KMeans)
- Predict lead conversion using a Random Forest classifier
- Identify key features driving conversions
- Visualize campaign performance metrics for strategic insights

## ðŸ§  Techniques Used

| Category | Techniques/Tools |
|----------|------------------|
| Data Cleaning | Pandas, Regex, Type Conversion |
| Feature Engineering | Age Range Extraction, One-Hot Encoding |
| Visualization | Seaborn, Matplotlib |
| Supervised Learning | Random Forest Classifier |
| Unsupervised Learning | KMeans Clustering, PCA (optional) |
| Model Evaluation | Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score |
| Scaling | StandardScaler |

## Key Features
1. Conversion Rate Analysis: Visual distribution and threshold setting

2. Clustering: Segment campaigns into behaviorally distinct groups

3. Lead Conversion Prediction: Trained Random Forest classifier

4. Feature Importance: Determine what influences conversion most

5. Performance Metrics: Evaluate model accuracy, recall, F1, etc.

## Insights
1. Campaigns targeting Men 18-24 via Email and Google Ads had higher conversion rates.

2. Acquisition Cost and impressions are major factors in lead conversion.

3. Clustering revealed distinct cost-performance groupings, helping identify underperforming segments.
